# INSPIRE XML schemas

The purpose of this repository is to manage the changes to the INSPIRE XML schemas.

The INSPIRE XML schemas can be categorized in two categories:

* GML application schemas, derived from the UML application schemas
* XML schemas used in the Extended Capabilities section of INSPIRE spatial data services based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) WxS Services

The official location of the INSPIRE XML schemas — to be used within the INSPIRE resources — is, and will remain, https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas. This repository is only a means to facilitate the change management process of the INSPIRE schemas.

## Governance and release process

Change proposals to the current version of the schemas can be proposed and discussed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/application-schemas/issues/) of this repository. These change proposals are then subject to the specific governance and release process, whose workflow and actors involved are detailed in [this document](/governance-release-process/process.md).
