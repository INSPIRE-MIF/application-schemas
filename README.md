# INSPIRE XSD application schemas

The purpose of this repository is to manage the changes to the INSPIRE XSD application schemas (hereafter INSPIRE schemas).

The official location of the INSPIRE schemas — to be used within the INSPIRE resources — is, and will remain, https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas. This repository, which is setup within [Action 2.3](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/Action+2.3+Simplification+of+INSPIRE+implementation) of the [INSPIRE MIWP 2021-2024](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24), is only a means to facilitate the change management process of the INSPIRE schemas.

Change proposals to the current version of the schemas can be proposed and discussed in the issue tracker of this repository. These change proposals are then subject to the specific governance process, whose workflow and actors involved and detailed in [this document](xxx).

A new version of the schemas, including the changes which are endorsed after going thorugh the governance process, will be released twice per year in June and December. After each release (available on GitHub), the schemas at https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas will be updated accordingly.
