# INSPIRE XSD application schemas

The purpose of this repository is to manage the changes to the INSPIRE XSD application schemas (hereafter INSPIRE schemas).

The official location of the INSPIRE schemas - to be used within the INSPIRE resources - is, and will remain, https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas. This repository, which is setup within [Action 2.3](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/Action+2.3+Simplification+of+INSPIRE+implementation) of the [INSPIRE MIWP 2021-2024](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24), is only a means to facilitate the change management process of the INSPIRE schemas.

Changes to the current version of the schemas can be proposed and discussed in the issue tracker of this repository; they are then subject to the specific governance process described in [this document](xxx).
