The schemas included in this folder are a modified version of the schemas included in the folder https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/draft-schemas/inspire-md-schemas.

The modifications were made to address the recent transfer of ISO resources to HTTPS (see for example this issue: https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/21) in the INSPIRE Reference Validator,
which does not support HTTP redirection to HTTPS.

In particular, schemalocation statements have been updated to refer to ISO/TC 211 XML Schemas available on the OGC schema repository instaed of the ISO repository.
