# Management of changes to the INSPIRE schemas (UML models and XSD schemas)

This document describes the approach to be adopted for the management of changes to the INSPIRE schemas, meant as the combination of UML models and XSD application schemas. It covers the whole process from the initial stage of change proposal up to the final stage of endorsement and actual change implementation. It defines actors, responsibilities and (partially) timelines for each stage of the process, but it deliberately does not (yet) describe the practical tools to be used in each process. These will be added to the document in a second phase.

## Governance process

The process to update/change INSPIRE schemas varies depending on the type of change proposed and its foreseen impact. Based on this, different scenarios are envisaged. They are all captured in the flowchart below and described in the following.

[to be moved and extended below] A release plan for the INSPIRE schemas, which complements this document, will be provided shortly. This will detail the frequency of releases of the endorsed changes and the exact target dates of such releases – for example, twice per year in January and July. In addition to the scheduled releases, hotfix releases of the schemas, i.e. releases that fix critical bugs, might be released at any time. Each release will be accompanied by a clear changelog listing and explaining the changes made.

The first actor involved in the governance process is the **change proposer**, i.e. the person, organisation or group of people/organisations that submits a change proposal. The change proposer shall outline the need for the change in a schema, explaining if this is needed because of a bug or because the current version does not fit specific use cases (to be adequately described). The change proposer shall then describe the proposed change and explain whether it would have an impact on the Technical Guidance documents (TG) and/or on the Implementing Rules (IR). The change proposal shall be described be opening a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/application-schemas/issues) of this repository.

The next actor involved in the governance process is the **MIWP Sub-group of experts** (referred to as Sub-group in the following), supervised by the JRC and created within [Action 2.3 “Simplification of INSPIRE implementation”](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/Action+2.3+Simplification+of+INSPIRE+implementation) of the [INSPIRE MIWP 2020-2024](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24). The Sub-group shall evaluate the proposal and, in a first step, check whether: i) it is a reasonable change proposal; and ii) the change proposal (including the impact) is correct, clear, described with a sufficient level of detail, and the impact of the change in the schema is the one described by the change proposer. To do so, the Sub-group shall interact with the change proposer and shall be closely supported by the INSPIRE **helpdesk facilitators**. The latter shall also contribute to the analysis of the change proposal and make sure it covers all the required points and is ready to be discussed by the Sub-group. All the interactions between the change proposer, the Sub-group and the helpdesk facilitators shall happen in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/application-schemas/issues) of this repository, in the form of a discussion under the same issue initially created.

If the change proposal (including the impact) is not reasonable and/or not correct, not clear, or not described with a sufficient level of detail, the Sub-group shall either reject it or ask the change proposer to improve it – with the help of the helpdesk facilitators – and submit it again. On the opposite, if the change proposal is correct, clear and described with a sufficient level of detail, depending on the type of change proposal to the schema, the workflow can follow two different paths (see below) based on a decision of the Sub-group. To determine what is the most suitable path for the specific type of change proposed, the Sub-group reserves the right to ask the change proposer for additional evidence or justification of the change proposal (to be given by e.g. a MIG/MIG-T member); no evidence shall instead be required in the cases of clear bugs to a schema (see below). The two paths are the following:

1) If the proposed change analysed by the Sub-group is obvious and minor, e.g. there is a clear bug to an application schema and the proposal is to fix it, with no impact on the TG and no impact on the IR, the Sub-group shall approve the change and invite the **INSPIRE Coordination Team (CT)** to endorse it. An example of an obvious and minor change proposal to an INSPIRE schema is available at https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/402. The INSPIRE CT shall either: i) endorse the proposal; ii) reject the proposal; or iii) ask the change proposer to amend the proposal and submit it again. If the change proposal is rejected by the INSPIRE CT, the whole process ends; if the INSPIRE CT asks that the change proposal is amended, the change proposer shall amend it according to the feedback received and submit it again.
 
2) If the proposed change analysed by the Sub-group is major, i.e. it impacts the TG and/or the IR, the following actor in the process is the **INSPIRE MIG-T**. The change proposal is presented by the Sub-group (ideally together with the same change proposer) to the MIG-T during the second or the fourth MIG-T meetings of the year, indicatively taking place in April and October. The MIG-T members, which will receive the rationale for the change proposal in written form before the meeting, will be able to ask questions and discuss with the change proposer and express themselves in favor or against the change proposal. An overall decision (in favor/against) from the MIG-T shall be taken during the meeting through a voting process, where MIG-T members voting against the proposal or abstaining from voting need to provide justification. The MIG-T shall either: i) endorse the proposal; ii) reject the proposal; or iii) ask the change proposer to amend the proposal and submit it again. If the change proposal is rejected by the MIG-T, the whole process ends; if the MIG-T asks that the change proposal is amended, the change proposer shall amend it according to the feedback received and submit it again. 

If the change proposal is endorsed by the INSPIRE CT or by the MIG-T, respectively in cases 1) and 2) above, the **INSPIRE MIG** is informed about the change proposal and a two-week time window starts, during which MIG members can raise objections to the proposal. If at least an objection is raised during the two-week time window, the change proposal is discussed at the first MIG meeting immediately following the two-week time window. An overall decision (in favor/against) from the MIG shall be taken during the meeting through a voting process, where MIG members voting against the proposal or abstaining from voting need to provide justification. The MIG shall either: i) endorse the proposal; ii) reject the proposal; or iii) ask the change proposer to amend the proposal and submit it again. If the change proposal is rejected by the MIG, the whole process ends; if the MIG asks that the change proposal is amended, the change proposer shall amend it according to the feedback received and submit it again.

If no objection is raised by MIG members during the two-week time window, or if the change proposal is endorsed by the MIG during the meeting, the JRC shall implement the change in the relevant schema and – if relevant – in the TG. It must be noted that the TG will have their own governance process (to be defined soon), based on a specific group of actors (similar to the one for schemas) and a different release plan. If the endorsed change proposal has (also) an impact on the IR, the INSPIRE CT shall submit a proposal for a draft amendment of the IR. The endorsement of this proposal is subject to its own governance process (involving the Comitology procedure) and is outside the scope of the present document.
