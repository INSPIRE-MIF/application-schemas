# Management of changes to the INSPIRE schemas (UML models and XSD schemas)

This document describes the approach to be adopted for the management of changes to the INSPIRE schemas, meant as the combination of UML models and XSD application schemas. It covers the whole process from the initial stage of change proposal up to the final stage of endorsement and actual change implementation. It defines actors, responsibilities and (partially) timelines for each stage of the process, but it deliberately does not (yet) describe the practical tools to be used in each process. These will be added to the document in a second phase.

# Governance process

The process to update/change INSPIRE schemas varies depending on the type of change proposed and its foreseen impact. Based on this, different scenarios are envisaged. They are all captured in the flowchart below and described in the following.

A release plan for the INSPIRE schemas, which complements this document, will be provided shortly. This will detail the frequency of releases of the endorsed changes and the exact target dates of such releases â€“ for example, twice per year in January and July. In addition to the scheduled releases, hotfix releases of the schemas, i.e. releases that fix critical bugs, might be released at any time. Each release will be accompanied by a clear changelog listing and explaining the changes made.
